We're excited to share our latest work on arXiv:2507.05133 "[Coherent Spins in van der Waals Semiconductor GeS2 at Ambient Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05133)", where we demonstrate coherent control of spin defects in GeS₂. In this study, we observed optically addressable S = 1/2 defects at room temperature in this van der Waals material, establishing GeS₂ as a promising new host for quantum defects. Notably, GeS₂ can, in principle, be isotope purified to create a nuclear spin-free environment, offering a path to enhanced coherence times beyond what is achievable in similar defects hosted in hBN.
