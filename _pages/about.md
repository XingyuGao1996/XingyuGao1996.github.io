I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics  under the supervision of Prof. Tongcang Li at Purdue University. I am interested in solid-state quantum devices for the applications in quantum sensing, computation and communication. My current research focuses on spin qubits in solid-state materials, specifically, in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).
