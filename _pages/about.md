I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics  under the supervision of Prof. Tongcang Li at Purdue University. I am interested in solid-state quantum devices for the applications in quantum sensing, computation and communication. My current research focuses on spin qubits in solid-state materials, specifically, in hexagonal boron nitride.

# Research Directions

## Novel spin qubits in hexagonal boron nitride
Developing coherent control of individual quantum systems and harnessing this control to realize entanglement-based quantum devices is the central goal of the current quantum technologies.  Spin defects in solid state materials have recently emerged as one of the most promsing systems. A spin defect provides a spin–photon quantum interface that enables optical access to its electronic spins. The electron spins provide controllable qubits with long relaxation and coherence times.  Several spin defects have been well investigated but only a few defects in diamond and silicon carbide exhibit room temperature coherence properties.  

My research focuses on spin qubits in novel material platforms, specifically, in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). hBN is a van der Waals material and its layered structure offers capabilities to integrate with heterogeneous nanodevices. We discover and create optically active spin defects in hBN, and study these defects using the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique. We investigate $$V_B^-$$ spin defect ensembles and single carbon-related defects in hBN. In addition, we leverage these defects to detect, polarize and control the surrounding nuclear spins. The nuclear spins generally exhibit significantly longer coherence times compared with the electronic spins.  The capability of controlling inidividual nuclear spins enbales long-live nucelar spin quantum registers to overcome the short coherence time of hBN spin defects.
